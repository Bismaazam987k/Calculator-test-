# Calculator-Using-HTML-CSS-and-Javascript

**Title:** "Calculator" is our application's title.

**Output Screen:** The output screen is where all text will be displayed. User inputs are typed and results are calculated based on that input. Again, we can consider this in two parts as follows:
* **Question Output:**
This will be the input given by the user.
* **Answer Output:**
This will be the result calculated from user input.

**Operations:** This calculator can perform following operations which are listed below:

```
Addition
Substraction
Multiplication
Division
Persentage
Square root
```
## File Structure
```
calc.js
```

## Prerequisites: 
* Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript needed. 

The project contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in React app. The HTML file adds structure, followed by styling using CSS and JavaScript adds functionality to it and for making validations to certain parts of the project.

HTML layout is created using the div tags, id attributes, classes, input, and buttons for submission. It defines the structure of the web page.

## Output:

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
